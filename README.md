# Deploy Next.js apps to Cloudflare

[OpenNext for Cloudflare](https://opennext.js.org/cloudflare) is Cloudflare specific adapter that enables deployment of Next.js applications to Cloudflare.

This monorepo includes a package for adapting a Next.js application built via `next build` (in standalone mode) to run in the Cloudflare workerd runtime using the [Workers Node.js compatibility layer](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs/).

## Get started

### The repository

The repository contains two directories:

- `packages` containing a cloudflare package that can be used to build Cloudflare workers compatible output from Next.js applications
- `examples` containing Next.js applications that use the above mentioned cloudflare.

### How to try out/develop in the repository

Install the dependencies:

```sh
pnpm i
```

build the worker with:

```sh
pnpm --filter cloudflare build
```

or in watch mode with:

```sh
pnpm --filter cloudflare build:watch
```

build and preview the worker for the `api` application:

```sh
pnpm --filter api preview:worker
```

You can skip building the next app when it has not been modified:

```sh
SKIP_NEXT_APP_BUILD=true pnpm --filter api preview:worker
```
